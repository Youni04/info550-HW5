# Analysis of HELP dataset

**Data used** /n
The dataset used here is the HELP dataset (Health Evaluation and Linkage to Primary Care), which is data from a clinical trial for adult inpatients recruited from a detoxification unit. Patients with no primary care physician were randomized to receive a multidisciplinary assessment and a brief motivational intervention or usual care, with the goal of linking them to primary medical care.

**Analysis** /n
The aim of this analysis is to use linear regression to understand the relationship between Risk Assessment Battery (RAB) drug risk score and our primary exposure, perceived social support, adjusting for age and gender. We then do some regression diagnostics to understand if our model is a good fit.
